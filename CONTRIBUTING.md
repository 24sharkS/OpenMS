Help us to make OpenMS better and become part of the OpenMS open source community.

#General remarks:

There are many ways how you can contribute without needing to program. For instance, you can:
  - report issues like bugs
  - pose questions
  - point out missing documentation
  - request new features
  - write/update documentation

If you are a programmer you can open a Pull Request to:
  - implement new algorithms, features or tools
  - fix bugs and resolve issues

we are happy to review your contributions and point out potential ways on how to improve them.

#Reporting an issue:
If you found a bug, e.g. an OpenMS tool crashes during data processing, it is essential to provide some basic information:
  - the OpenMS version you are running
  - the platform you are running OpenMS on (Windows 10, ...)
  - how you installed OpenMS (e.g., from within KNIME, binary installers, self compiled)
  - a description on how to reproduce the bug
  - relevant tool output (e.g., error messages)
  - data to repoduce the bug (If possible as a github gist. Other platforms like dropbox, google drive links also work. If you can't share the data publicly please indicate this and we will contact you in private.)

Optionally:
  - label your issue using github labels (e.g. as: question, defect) that indicated the type of issue and which components of OpenMS (blue labels) are affected. The severity is usually assigned by OpenMS maintainers and used internally to e.g. indicate if a bug is a blocker for a new release.

#Opening a Pull Request

Before getting started we recommend taking a look at our GitHub-Wiki: https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/wiki#-for-developers

There you will find information on:
 - coding conventions
 - testing
 - additional documentation for developers. 
 
The section on "Development model" will give details on how to incorporate your contributions into the OpenMS code base. A core developer will review your changes and approve them (or ask for modifications).

Also consider getting in contact with the core developers early. They might provide additional guidance and valuable information on how your specific aim is achieved. This might give you a head start in, for example, developing novel tools or algorithms. 

Happy coding!
