Help us to make OpenMS better and become part of the OpenMS open source community.

There are many ways how you can contribute:
  - write/update documentation
  - implement new algorithms, features or tools
  - fix bugs and resolve issues
  - many more... 

Before getting started we recommend taking a look at our GitHub-Wiki: https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/wiki#-for-developers

There you will find information on coding conventions, testing and additional documentation for developers. The section on "Development model" will give details on how to incorporate your contributions into the OpenMS code base. A core developer will review your changes and approve them (or ask for modifications).

Also consider getting in contact with the core developers early. They might provide additional guidance and valuable information on how your specific aim is achieved. This might give you a head start in, for example, developing novel tools or algorithms. 

Happy coding!
