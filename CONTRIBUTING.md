Help us to make OpenMS better.
Among other things, you can
  - implement new features (mostly C++)
  - write/update documentation
  - fix bugs
  - ...
  
To incorporate your contributions, a pull request against the OpenMS 'develop' branch is probably
the most efficient way. A core developer will review your changes and approve them (or ask for modifications).

Further details on our GitHub-Wiki: https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/wiki#-for-developers

Happy coding!
