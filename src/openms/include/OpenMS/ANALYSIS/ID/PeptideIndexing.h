/**
  @brief Refreshes the protein references for all peptide hits in a vector of PeptideIdentifications and adds target/decoy information.

  All peptide and protein hits are annotated with target/decoy information, using the meta value "target_decoy". For proteins the possible values are "target" and "decoy", 
  depending on whether the protein accession contains the decoy pattern (parameter @p decoy_string) as a suffix or prefix, respectively (see parameter @p prefix).
  For peptides, the possible values are "target", "decoy" and "target+decoy", depending on whether the peptide sequence is found only in target proteins,
  only in decoy proteins, or in both. The target/decoy information is crucial for the @ref TOPP_FalseDiscoveryRate tool.
  (For FDR calculations, "target+decoy" peptide hits count as target hits.)

  @note Make sure that your protein names in the database contain a correctly formatted decoy string. This can be ensured by using @ref UTILS_DecoyDatabase.
        If the decoy identifier is not recognized successfully all proteins will be assumed to stem from the target-part of the query.<br>
        E.g., "sw|P33354_DECOY|YEHR_ECOLI Uncharacterized lipop..." is <b>invalid</b>, since the tool has no knowledge of how SwissProt entries are build up.
        A correct identifier could be "DECOY_sw|P33354|YEHR_ECOLI Uncharacterized li ..." or "sw|P33354|YEHR_ECOLI_DECOY Uncharacterized li", depending on whether you are
        using prefix or suffix annotation.<br>
        This tool will also report some helpful target/decoy statistics when it is done.

  By default this tool will fail if an unmatched peptide occurs, i.e. if the database does not contain the corresponding protein.
  You can force it to return successfully in this case by using the flag @p allow_unmatched.

  Search engines (such as Mascot) will replace ambiguous amino acids ('B', 'J', 'Z' and 'X') in the protein database with unambiguous amino acids in the reported peptides, e.g. exchange 'X' with 'H'.
  This will cause such peptides to not be found by exactly matching their sequences to the protein database.
  However, we can recover these cases by using tolerant search for ambiguous amino acids in the protein sequence. This is done by default with up to four amino acids
  per peptide hit. If you only want exact matches, set @p aaa_max to zero (but expect that unmatched peptides might occur)!

  Leucine/Isoleucine:
  Further complications can arise due to the presence of the isobaric amino acids isoleucine ('I') and leucine ('L') in protein sequences.
  Since the two have the exact same chemical composition and mass, they generally cannot be distinguished by mass spectrometry.
  If a peptide containing 'I' was reported as a match for a spectrum, a peptide containing 'L' instead would be an equally good match (and vice versa).
  To account for this inherent ambiguity, setting the flag @p IL_equivalent causes 'I' and 'L' to be considered as indistinguishable.@n
  For example, if the sequence "PEPTIDE" (matching "Protein1") was identified as a search hit,
  but the database additionally contained "PEPTLDE" (matching "Protein2"), running PeptideIndexer with the @p IL_equivalent option would
  report both "Protein1" and "Protein2" as accessions for "PEPTIDE".
  (This is independent of ambiguous matching via @p aaa_max.)
  Additionally, setting this flag will convert all 'J's in any protein sequence to 'I'. This way, no tolerant search is required for 'J' (but is still possible for all
  the other ambiguous amino acids).
  If @p write_protein_sequences is requested and @p IL_equivalent is set as well, both the I/L-version and unmodified protein sequences need to be stored internally.
  This requires some extra memory, roughly equivalent to the size of the FASTA database file itself.

  Enzyme specificity:
  Once a peptide sequence is found in a protein sequence, this does <b>not</b> imply that the hit is valid! This is where enzyme specificity comes into play.
  By default, we demand that the peptide is fully tryptic (i.e. the enzyme parameter is set to "trypsin" and specificity is "full").
  So unless the peptide coincides with C- and/or N-terminus of the protein, the peptide's cleavage pattern should fulfill the trypsin cleavage rule [KR][^P].
  
  We make two exceptions to the specificity constraints:
  1) for peptides starting at the second or third position of a protein are still considered N-terminally specific,
  since the residues can be cleaved off in vivo; X!Tandem reports these peptides. For example, the two peptides ABAR and LABAR would both match a protein starting with MLABAR.
  2) adventitious cleavage at Asp|Pro (Aspartate/D | Proline/P) is allowed for all enzymes (as supported by X!Tandem), i.e. counts as a proper cleavage site (see http://www.thegpm.org/tandem/release.html).
  
  You can relax the requirements further by choosing <tt>semi-tryptic</tt> (only one of two "internal" termini must match requirements)
  or <tt>none</tt> (essentially allowing all hits, no matter their context). These settings should not be used (due to high risk of reporting false positives),
  unless the search engine was instructed to search peptides in the same way.
  
  Threading:
  This tool support multiple threads (@p threads option) to speed up computation, at the cost of little extra memory.
