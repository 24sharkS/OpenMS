# This file contains OpenMS- and user-defined RNA modifications.
# It is read in addition to the Modomics data file ("Modomics.tsv") and uses the same format.
# For terminal modifications, the "new_nomenclature" value has to end in "N" and contain either "33" (3'-terminal mod.) or "55" (5'-terminal mod.).
