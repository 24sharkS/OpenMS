# External project example

This project shows howto compile custom code against OpenMS.

Additionally this project serves as a test case for nightly builds to ensure that linking against OpenMS works.

## Usage

 1. Compile OpenMS
 2. Create the environment variable `OPENMS_BUILD_TREE` (e.g., `export OPENMS_BUILD_TREE=<path-where-you-compiled-OpenMS>`)
 3. Create an additional build directory for this example project (e.g., `mkdir example-build`)
 4. Call CMake from the new directory and add the path to this directory.

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64" <path-to-this-directory>
```
